## Installation

- [Download file](#Download file)

### Set-Up

#### If you have already Install RUBY skip to [Download-file](#Download-file) Section

- Let's start with updating our apt

  ```bash
	sudo apt-get update
	```

- Then we need to install Ruby

	```bash
	sudo apt-get install ruby-full
	```

	Let's verify it's working correctly by opening a text editor and saving the following text as test.rb

	```bash
	#!/usr/bin/env ruby
	puts "Hello world!"
	```

	In the terminal window, change directory to the directory where you saved test.rb. Run the command
	```bash
	chmod +x test.rb
	./test.rb
	```

	Then you should see the message Hello world! displayed if Ruby is installed correctly.

	If it didn't work, check [Ruby Installation Page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
